For most federal student loans, you can request a period of deferment or forbearance if you’re experiencing financial hardship. However, interest will continue to accrue on your loans while they’re in forbearance or (in certain cases) deferment. This will cause your balance to increase, meaning you’ll pay more over the life of your loans. Additionally, if you’re working toward student loan forgiveness, deferment and forbearance periods may not count toward your progress.

Forbearance and deferment can give you some much-needed breathing room during a recession, but a more affordable, long-term solution would be a better option. As an alternative, you may be able to switch to an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. Under one of these plans, your monthly federal student loan payments would be commensurate with your income. If you’re unable to afford your current repayment plan, consider switching to a new one that offers a lower payment.
