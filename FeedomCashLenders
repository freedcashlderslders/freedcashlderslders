There are two primary types of student loans: federal and private. Federal student loans are backed by the government, typically have lower interest rates, and usually include more favorable repayment options. Private student loans are offered by banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions, and theyâ€™re often more expensive and less flexible when compared to their federal counterparts.

If you fail to make your student loan payments on time, you could face serious financial consequences. Federal student loans are usually reported as delinquent within 60 to 90 days, depending on the loan type. Meanwhile, private student loans can be reported delinquent in as little as 30 days after a missed payment.
